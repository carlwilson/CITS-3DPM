| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Archival Creator** | Organisation unit or individual that creates records and/or manages records during their active use. |
| **Archival Information Package (AIP)** | An information package, consisting of the Content Information and the associated Preservation Description Information (PDI), which is preserved within an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). |
| **Asymetric Keys** | Asymmetric keys are pairs of keys, created in one step; they can be used in both directions. Encryption with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key; if the encryption is done with the private key, the decryption can only done with the public key; such a key pair can be used for encryption and for signing |
| **Authentication** | Term needs verifying by DILCIS |
| **Cardinality** | The term describes the possible number of occurrences for elements in a set. The numbers have the following meanings: |
|  | (1..1) – in each set, there is exactly 1 such element present; |
|  | (0..1) – the set can contain from 0 to 1 of such elements; |
|  | (1..n) – the set contains at least one element; |
|  | (0..n) – the set can contain up to n of such elements, but it is not mandatory; |
|  | (0..0) – the element is prohibited to use. |
| **Content Data Object** | The Data Object, that together with associated Representation Information comprises the Content Information (OAIS – ISO 14721:2012). |
| **Content Information** | A set of information that is the origibal target of preservation or includes part or all of that information. It is an Information Object composed of its Content Data Object and its Representation Information (OAIS – ISO 14721:2012). |
| **Data File** | A component which contains data and has an associated MIME file type.  A Data File can encapsulate multiple bit streams and metadata according to a standard such as a DICOM but must have a recognised MIME file type. A Data File may comprise one or more subsidiary Byte Streams; for example, an MP4 file might contain separate audio and video streams, each of which has its own associated metadata. |
| **Data Quality Rules** | Data Quality or Verification rules ensure that a representation of a product model meets quality requirements within defined tolerances, i.e. that a specific representation represents the Product Model with sufficient accuracy. |
| **Derived Representation** | A transformation of the native data, which may be based on a Native Format or a Standardised Format, e.g. an html version may be derived from a text document as an alternative representation. |
| **Digital Signature** | An Digital Signature is a defined method to sign an object in electronic environments; it provides means to authenticate the signatory and the signed object in an unambiguous and safe way by attaching to or logically associating data in electronic form to other electronic objects. |
| **Dissemenation Information Package (DIP)** | An Information Package, derived from one or more AIPs and sent by Archives to the Consumer in response to a request to the OAIS. |
| **Document** | A single or group of related Data Files with common metadata. For example, a Document may consist of a PDF file together with associated attachments or a word file with a separate image signature sheet. A document can be considered to be an entity that is approved/signed as a whole by a practitioner. |
| **Information Package** | A logical container composed of optional Content Information and optional associated Preservation Description Information used to delimit and identify the Content Information and Package Description information used to facilitate searches for the Content Information. |
| **Internal Archival Long Term Preservation guidelines** | This type of guideline can have different names depending on the creator. Generally, archives specify technical guidelines and/or regulations for formats, specifying what they will accept and maintain for the long term/ Depending on the archive and available technical resources, the criteria for the selected formats can differ from archive to archive. |
| **Level** | The level of requirements of the element following RFC 2119 (<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>): |
|  | MUST – this means that the definition is an absolute requirement; |
|  | SHOULD – this means that in particular circumstances, valid reasons may exist to ignore the requirement, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course(<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>); |
|  | MUST NOT – this means that the prohibition described in the requirement is an absolute prohibition of the use of the element; |
|  | SHOULD NOT – this means that in particular circumstances, violating the prohibition described in the requirement is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before doing so. The requirement text should clarify such circumstances; |
|  | MAY – means that a requirement is entirely optional. |
| **Open Archival Information System (OAIS)** | An Archive consisting of an organisation, which may be part of a larger organisation, of people and systems, that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community. It meets a set of responsibilities that allows an OAIS Archive to be distinguished from other uses of the term ‘Archive’. |
| **Original Product Model or Native Representation** | Used specially to keep the design intent for long term archiving in the contact of certification and legal requirements for proof. It can be stored in native or standardised formats (LOTAR). |
| **Preservation Description Information (PDI)** | The information which is necessary for adequate preservation of the Content Information and which can be categorised as Provenance, Reference, Fixity and Access Rights Information. (LOTAR). |
| **Product Information Model** | A Product Information Model represents an information model which provides an abstract description of facts, concepts and instructions about a product e.g. STEP (ISO 10303-1:1994) Application reference model or STEP Application interpreted model. |
| **Product Model** | A Product Model represents an occurrence of a product information model for a particular product, e.g. the geometric model of a part 123. Companies will create Product Models of different types, depending on the life cycle stages or disciplines, e.g. there are Product Models of type ‘space allocation mock up’. Product Models are independent from their presentation. |
| **Public Key** | A public key is the part of the asymmetric key pair that is known to everyone. |
| **Private Key** | A private key is the part of the asymmetric key pair that is only known by the owner of the asymmetric key pair. |
| **RDBMS** | Relational Database Management System|
| **Representation** | A Representation within an Infiormation Package contains archival data. If an Information Package contains the same data in two or more different formats (i.e. an original and a long term preservation format) or in different types of organisations (arrangements), the are placed within two or more separate Representations within the Representations folder of the Information Package of the Information Package. |
| **Representation Information** | The Representation Information must enable or allow the re-creation of the significant properties of the original data object. |
| **Standardised Machine- readable Documentation** | A standardised machine-readable document is a document whose content can be readily processed by computers and is based on a commonly accepted standard. Such documents are distinguished from machine-readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created. |
| **Standardised Open Format** | A format of data in a syntax which is derived by as broad community, such as ISO and which is independent of a specific system or interface. “Open” means completely and precisely documented in syntax and semantics and is applicable for free. In addition, standardisation processes regulate the change process for the standard.(LOTAR) |
| **Submission Agreement** | The agreement reached between an archive and the submission producer that specifies a submission format (3D PM CITS), and any other arrangements needed, for the data submission session. Any special conditions on patient confidentiality could be specified in the submission agreement. |
| **Submission Information Package (SIP)** | An Information Package that is delivered by the Producer to the OAIS for use in the construction or update of one or more AIPs and/or the associated Descriptive Information. |
| **Submitting Organisation** | Name of the organisation submitting the package to the archive. |
| **Time Stamp/Signature** | A time signature is created automatically as part of a certified process and requires certified hardware; it provides a legal guarantee for time and owner of the data (LOTAR). |
| **Validation** | Validation is applied to guarantee the integrity of the content of a Document throughout the entire process of long-term archiving. In the context of LOTAR  the validation will be done by calculation and comparison of Validation Properties. A set of Validation Properties is like a fingerprint for the content of the document. Each change of the content changes one or more attributes of the Validation Properties. Validation properties should be independent from the system and representation within given deviations (LOTAR). |
| **Validation Properties** | Validation properties are measurable characteristics of a given Product Model that can demonstrate the veracity of a representation of the model. E.g. weight, center of gravity. Validation properties are calculated during the process of Validation for each representation of the model, e.g. STEP (LOTAR). |
| **Validation Properties Rules Data** | Validation Properties Rules Data is the original Validation Properties derived from the source Product Model (LOTAR). |
| **Verification** | A process to ensure that data is correctly represented (e.g in a package representation). Verification rules ensure that a data representation meet he quality requirements within defined tolerances. Verification rules at domain specific (CAD, PDM, Electronic Assembly, Fluid Dynamics) and are defined within LOTAR (LOTAR). |
