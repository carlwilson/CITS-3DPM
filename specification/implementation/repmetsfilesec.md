#### Representation METS file metadata section (element fileSec)

The CSIP does not make the use of the METS fileSec element mandatory, but it is strongly recommended. In the 3D Product Model CITS, the use of the METS fileSec element at the Representation level becomes mandatory, such as to reference the Content Data Objects within each Representation and link to preservation information held within mandatory PREMIS files.
