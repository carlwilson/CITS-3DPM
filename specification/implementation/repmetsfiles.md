#### Representation METS Files

The Representation METS files are used to describe the data structure as included in the data folder of each Representation (Product Model representations) via the structMap element and to reference additional descriptive and preservation metadata.

#### Representation METS root element

CITS 3D PM does not change or extend any of the requirements for the Representation root element but particular notice is drawn to the specific requirements of a Representation METS root element and the specific content type attributes to be used in CITS 3D PM.
